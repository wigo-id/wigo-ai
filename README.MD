# WIGO Project - README

## Overview
WIGO is a comprehensive tourism and attraction platform aimed at providing an all-in-one solution for users to manage their travel journeys. It covers needs such as ticketing, media promotion, government promotion, and also supports POS systems for tourism businesses. The system is designed with a service-oriented architecture that includes:

- **Backend API**: Built with **NestJS**
- **Client Mobile App**: Developed with **Flutter**
- **LLM-based Recommendation System**: Implemented in **Python**

This README provides an overview of the project structure, installation steps, and how to contribute to the development.

## Architecture Overview

The WIGO platform consists of three main components:

- **Backend API (NestJS)**: Handles the core logic, routes, authentication, database management, and integrations with third-party services like payment gateways.
  
- **Mobile App (Flutter)**: The client-side interface used by tourists and tourism businesses to interact with the WIGO platform. It provides users with easy access to booking services, POS systems, and recommendations.

- **LLM Recommendation System (Python)**: Processes big data of tourism and attraction places to provide AI-powered suggestions using the **Llama 3 model** for personalized user experiences. It interfaces with the backend to deliver intelligent recommendations based on user queries.
